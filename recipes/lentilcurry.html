    <ol>
        <li>
            Heat oil in a pot over medium-low heat and cook onions, garlic, and ginger until fragrant, 3 to 5 minutes. Sprinkle with sugar and cumin, and cook until sugar caramelizes, about 2 minutes, making sure cumin does not burn. Stir in curry paste; cook for 1 to 2 minutes. Add potatoes, lentils, coconut milk, and tomatoes and their juice. Season with vegetable bouillon and bring to a boil.

            Cover and simmer until potatoes and lentils are cooked through, 20 to 25 minutes, stirring occasionally. Season with lemon juice, salt, and pepper.
